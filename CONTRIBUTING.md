## Introduction

[Harmonoid](https://github.com/harmonoid/harmonoid) brings the best, cross platform **music experience** for all the users. The app follows modern design standard and provides good set of features in small installation size.

## Contribution

The app's core logic (like local music indexing, sorting, playlist management & YouTube playback) is inside the [core](./lib/core) directory & all user interface related code is inside the [interface](./lib/interface) directory. [Provider](https://github.com/rrousselGit/provider) is used for state management.

If you're an outsider (yet), fork the project today & add your features. We are actively looking for contributors. If you decide to contribute, add yourself to the about page of the app. We look forward to make you an organization member aswell.

If you're already an organization member & working any reported bug / feature, make sure to close the issue only when a new release is published (not when bug is fixed). Since, we want [Harmonoid](https://github.com/harmonoid/harmonoid) to be ready for users. We are making it for consumers & users, not just developers.
