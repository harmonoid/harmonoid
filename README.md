## Planned Features

May be found at: [What's next for Harmonoid? & Release Goals](https://github.com/harmonoid/harmonoid/issues/348).

## Why

It's really hard to find software with good design & animations on desktop. It's almost like desktop app developers don't have faith in adding animations to their UI. Other music players, which look kind-of good don't work properly, refuse to support an audio format, read tags incorrectly, don't have my favorite feature or simply use electron.js.

Harmonoid very strictly implements Material Design to be a consistent, cohesive & modern music player for all platforms. There are no inconsistent paddings, spacings or weird alignments to make me feel uncomfortable. It's built with care & proper time is given to everything.
