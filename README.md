## Contribute

As of now, the project contains **OVER 10K LINES OF CODE**.

Recently, it is migrated to use [Provider](https://github.com/rrousselGit/provider) for its state management. At few, places `StatefulWidget`s are still present.

The project supports sorting of music based on media metadata tags & native playback directly from file explorer etc. The whole user interface strictly follows the material design guidelines.

Checkout [project structure](https://github.com/alexmercerind/harmonoid#structure) to get started.

The plan of project is to bring the best, cross platform music experience for all users.
